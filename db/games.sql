Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements.

In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an exploding kitten, at which point they explode, they are Dead, and they are out of the game -- unless that player has a defuse card, which can defuse the kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the exploding kittens. Exploding kittens is the most-backed crowd funded project ever, the most-funded game in the history of Kickstarter, and has paved the way for peace and tranquility in the modern world.','Speck',NULL,2,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,2.15076923076923,'https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/40x40/games/uploaded/1559257206847-51osODpsNIL.jpg','https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/150x150/games/uploaded/1559257206847-51osODpsNIL.jpg','https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/350x350/games/uploaded/1559257206847-51osODpsNIL.jpg','https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/uploaded/1559257206847-51osODpsNIL.jpg','https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559257206847-51osODpsNIL.jpg',NULL,'2019-06-24 17:16:54.370940','2019-06-24 17:16:54.370940');
